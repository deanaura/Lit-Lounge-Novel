                                Reincarnated into a novel where my favorite character breathes and lives.

                                The beauty claimed to be the most beautiful in the continent. The jewel most cherished by the Emperor. The queen of the social circles. The time bomb of the Imperial Palace. I became Princess Agnes Saint, the one with all these titles and descriptions!

                                It’s nice being from a rich royal family, but… Like Draco Malfoy who scorned Muggles in Harry Potter, the problem was that ‘I’ was the despised tr*sh that insulted my favorite character’s integrity.

                                To make matters worse, she’s hopelessly courting another man. ‘My favorite character is Kylo, the male lead’s rival, and now I’ve reincarnated as a hardcore fan of the male lead…’

                                But now that it’s come to this… I will, at all costs, by any means possible, prevent my favorite character’s death and pave a flower path for him!

                                But if I suddenly reveal myself as a Kylo fan, everyone would think I’ve lost my mind. Kylo himself would suspect I’m a madwoman.

                                I didn’t want my baby cat, my Kylo, to be shocked in any way. So for now, I must hide this agonizing affection.

                                Plus, revealing your fandom has never done any good. So for the time being, I will perfectly…

                                ‘Hide it.’

                                Baek Nokha, a female solo idol, has perfect visuals, skills, and personality.

                                If it’s fandom, then she has a fandom. If it’s popularity, then she has popularity.

                                The moment she reached the peak of favorability and recognition without missing anything-

                                “…What’s up with these unmanaged vocal cords?”

                                Back to 10 years ago!

                                It’s not her own body, but someone else’s!

                                [Congratulations! You have became ‘Yoon Cheong’] [From now on, you must save the destined to fail girl group, ‘Steel Blue’!]

                                10 years since debut, won the grand prize for 3 years in a row.

                                Baek Nokha, a female solo idol, has perfect visuals, skills, and personality.

                                If it’s fandom, then she has a fandom. If it’s popularity, then she has popularity.

                                The moment she reached the peak of favorability and recognition without missing anything-

                                “…What’s up with these unmanaged vocal cords?”

                                Back to 10 years ago!

                                It’s not her own body, but someone else’s!

                                [Congratulations! You have became ‘Yoon Cheong’] [From now on, you must save the destined to fail girl group, ‘Steel Blue’!]

                                Reincarnated into a novel where my favorite character breathes and lives.

                                The beauty claimed to be the most beautiful in the continent. The jewel most cherished by the Emperor. The queen of the social circles. The time bomb of the Imperial Palace. I became Princess Agnes Saint, the one with all these titles and descriptions!

                                It’s nice being from a rich royal family, but… Like Draco Malfoy who scorned Muggles in Harry Potter, the problem was that ‘I’ was the despised tr*sh that insulted my favorite character’s integrity.

                                To make matters worse, she’s hopelessly courting another man. ‘My favorite character is Kylo, the male lead’s rival, and now I’ve reincarnated as a hardcore fan of the male lead…’

                                But now that it’s come to this… I will, at all costs, by any means possible, prevent my favorite character’s death and pave a flower path for him!

                                But if I suddenly reveal myself as a Kylo fan, everyone would think I’ve lost my mind. Kylo himself would suspect I’m a madwoman.

                                I didn’t want my baby cat, my Kylo, to be shocked in any way. So for now, I must hide this agonizing affection.

                                Plus, revealing your fandom has never done any good. So for the time being, I will perfectly…

                                Back to 10 years ago!

                                It’s not her own body, but someone else’s!

                                [Congratulations! You have became ‘Yoon Cheong’] [From now on, you must save the destined to fail girl group, ‘Steel Blue’!]

                                Reincarnated into a novel where my favorite character breathes and lives.

                                The beauty claimed to be the most beautiful in the continent. The jewel most cherished by the Emperor. The queen of the social circles. The time bomb of the Imperial Palace. I became Princess Agnes Saint, the one with all these titles and descriptions!

                                It’s nice being from a rich royal family, but… Like Draco Malfoy who scorned Muggles in Harry Potter, the problem was that ‘I’ was the despised tr*sh that insulted my favorite character’s integrity.

                                To make matters worse, she’s hopelessly courting another man. ‘My favorite character is Kylo, the male lead’s rival, and now I’ve reincarnated as a hardcore fan of the male lead…’

                                But now that it’s come to this… I will, at all costs, by any means possible, prevent my favorite character’s death and pave a flower path for him!

                                But if I suddenly reveal myself as a Kylo fan, everyone would think I’ve lost my mind. Kylo himself would suspect I’m a madwoman.

                                I didn’t want my baby cat, my Kylo, to be shocked in any way. So for now, I must hide this agonizing affection.

                                Plus, revealing your fandom has never done any good. So for the time being, I will perfectly…

                                ‘Hide it.’
